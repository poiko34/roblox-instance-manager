# 🎮 Roblox Instance Manager

> Utility for running multiple Roblox clients on one PC.

---

## 📌 Description

**Roblox Instance Manager** allows you to run multiple Roblox clients simultaneously on a single computer by automatically handling internal synchronization events used by Roblox.

The program works in **live mode** and continuously monitors running Roblox processes.

⚠️ **Use at your own risk.**

---

## ⚙️ How It Works (Short)

- The program runs in the background
- It monitors all `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe` processes
- If a specific internal Roblox event appears, it is automatically closed
- This allows multiple Roblox instances to run at the same time

---

## ▶️ How to Use

### 1️⃣ Start the program
Run the executable **before** launching Roblox.


The program will stay running and monitor Roblox processes automatically.

---

### 2️⃣ Launch Roblox clients
Open **as many Roblox clients as you need**.

You can:
- open Roblox normally
- use shortcuts
- use different launch methods

---

### 3️⃣ Log out of all accounts
Inside **each Roblox client**:
- Log out of the currently logged-in account

---

### 4️⃣ Log in to desired accounts
Now:
- Log in to the accounts you want
- Each Roblox client can use a **different account**

---

### 5️⃣ Play
That’s it 🎉  
You can now play with multiple Roblox accounts **simultaneously on one PC**.

---

## 🖥️ Requirements
